# README

Currently being build as a side project while I look for employment.

The idea is to make a online wardrobe, making it easier to view and match clothes while shopping or at a friends.

The project is currently in its very infant stages, but soon I hope you have it online, hosted on either Heroku or AWS.

I'm going to use rails to build the app as it is a language I feel comfortable using and allows for easy picture posting.
