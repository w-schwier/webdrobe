# Webdrobe

### What is it?

Currently being build as a side project while I look for employment.

The idea is to make a online wardrobe, making it easier to view and match clothes while shopping or at a friends.

The project is currently in its very infant stages, but soon I hope you have it online, hosted on either Heroku or AWS.


### My Approach

I'm going to use rails to build the app as it is a language I feel comfortable using and allows for easy picture posting.

### Future Features


### Installation

Open up terminal, change to the directory you want the repo and type ```git clone https://github.com/w-schwier/webdrobe```

Change into the directory ```cd webdrobe```

Install required gems by running ```bundle install``` If you don't already have bundle installed run ```brew install bundle```(this assumes you have homebrew installed)

To run the app enter: ``` bin/rails s ```

In a web browser visit [http://localhost:3000/garments](http://localhost:3000/garments)

### User Stories

As a user, so that I can see what clothes I have where, I want to be able to distinguish between locations.
